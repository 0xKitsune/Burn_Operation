## Overview

A Rust based CLI that completely wipes a computer securely, at the speed of light. Nice and handy when you need to initiate "Burn Operation". This program "zeros" the hard drive storage, making all of the data unrecoverable. Using `jwalk`, which enables parallelism through `rayon`, Rust is able to walk through a computer's directory tree at very high speeds.  

## How to use burn_operation

Instructions to install, add to path and execute. Ideally is a command in the terminal at any time that is just `burn_operation`.
